# FitOS

An x86 rust kernel that is bootable using multiboot2 and grub.

## Dpendencies

- Rust nightly later than 2020-12-11 with the `rust-src` components.
- [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) for assembling the startup code.
- `grub-mkrescue` command (or equivalent multiboot2 compatible bootloader)
- `qemu-system-i386` command for testing (optional).

## Creating an Image on Linux

``` bash
# Build kernel
cargo build

# Create bootdisk
mkdir -p target/bootdisk/boot/grub
cp res/grub.cfg target/bootdisk/boot/grub/grub.cfg
cp target/i586-bootloader/debug/fitos target/bootdisk/boot/fitos
grub-mkrescue -o target/fitos.iso target/bootdisk/

# Test image
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom target/fitos.iso
```
